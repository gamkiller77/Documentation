### Hey there!ðŸ‘‹

We're a group of people from around the globe, based in Canda.
Our project is the Prometheus mSLA printer, a resin printer that aims to be fully open-source.

This consists of:
<ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/Prometheus-MSLA">CAD</a></li>
    <li>The <a href="https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/Apollo">Apollo Controller Board</a></li>
    <li>The <a href="https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/PrometheusOS">Custom OS</a></li>
    <li>The Backend<a href="https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/Odyssey">Odyssey</a></li>
    <li>The Frontend (WIP)</li>
</ul>

We're aiming to stay as true to open-source as possible! As this is a WIP effort,
certain pieces of the source or documentation may not be available yet.
