### 3D Printed Parts

The Prometheus MSLA printer is a MSLA printer so the process of choosing the right filament for the job is not the same as a FDM (filament) printer. Resin contains a lot of chemicals that can react with various materials. With that in mind we suggest that all parts that may/will be in contact with resin be printed in a compatible or resistant material. There is also a big selection of blends or "plus" filaments that may not be compatible also. We suggest making tests with resin to see the impact on your filament.

The material  we suggest is PLA and PC due to its strong and stiff property. It also resists very well to the chemicals inside the composition of resin.
(Other plastics like PETG and PP are possible but have different physical properties and would need to be tested)

Materials that we do not suggest are Styrene based filament like ABS and ASA. Those will react with the chemicals and potentialy the fume coming from the resin.

### Slicer And Printer Settings

There are a few parts like the vat, vat ring and lcd braket that are oversized and will not fit in most 3D printers. You will need to have access to a printer of at least 350mmx350mm print area. If ever you don't have acces to that kind of printer their is a splitted version of those parts. This is still in experimentation and might not be the best due to a lot of stress coming from the tensioned FEP under the vat. You can also look at PCBWay that can print those parts for you.

We suggest using materials like PLA for all the parts that can come in contact with resin. Materials like ABS (or styrene base) will react with chemical inside the resin. Other materials like PC would be a strong candidate for this task.
 <span style="color: red"><b>*Do some testing beforehand to verify if your filament will be suitable. Some manufacturers use aditives that can react with chemicals.</b></span>

 For all the parts we suggest 6 walls (for a 0.4mm nozzel) and an infill of 35%. Also make sure that your printer is well tuned to avoid gaps between the walls.
